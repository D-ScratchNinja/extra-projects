# Cup of Coins `v0.5.0`

## [Download]()

## Description

Drop coins into a cup and let them merge into bigger coins, but don't let the cup overflow!

Physics will make the coins pile up in the cup. If two identical coins bump into each other, they'll combine into a bigger coin, and the coins will just keep getting bigger and bigger!

Be strategic — the cup can only hold so much. If a coin falls out of the cup, it's game over!
